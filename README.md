# Landmark-Detection-and-Tracking
This project uses simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for a 2 dimensional world!. SLAM gathers and uses information from a robot's sensors and motions over time  to create a map of an environment and provides a way to track the robots movement in real time.
